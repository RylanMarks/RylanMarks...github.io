        <h1>Apex Legends Coaching</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Apex Legends Coaching page. It goes over what tactics you can use to greatly improve your skill</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Apex Legends has many in-game mechanics thanks to it running on the same engine as both Titanfall games, with a few adjustments of course. Apex doesn't have the crazy mobility of Titanfall or Titanfall 2, but even without running on walls and double jumping, Movement is still the 2nd most important mechanic to learn, with the first most important mechanic being your aim with the guns.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>As I said before, movement mechanics are the 2nd most important thing to learn in apex. Some movement tactics are very easy, and others are much harder, and some are exclusive to a certain platform, which is entirely stupid but they aren't going to change it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Slide Jumping</h3>
        <p>Slide jumping is as easy as the name describes. Simply jump at the top of your slide, or when you have the most momentum, which is usually at the beginning of your slide. You can do this often as it serves as a small movement boost to give you a little more speed, which comes in more handy then you think. For example, you need to jump on something but don't have enough momentum to make the jump. Do a slide jump to give the movement boost necessary to make it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Wall Jump</h3>
        <p>A wall jump is entirely based around timing. It's not hard to do, but if timed wrong could entirely ruin the match. To do a wall jump, do a slide jump into a wall( you don't need to do a slide jump, but it is much more effective if you do), then as soon as you collide with the wall, tap the jump button. A wall jump is generally used to evade your enemy and get behind them, or to make your character harder to shoot.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Superglides</h3>
        <p>A superglide is the most difficult mechanic I will go over. Superglides; like wall jumps, are entirely based on timing, but are much harder to execute, and if failed, may cost the match. To do a superglide, you first have to mantle onto an object or the top of a wall. Then, right at the peak of your mantle, or before you climb up, hit the jump and crouch button at the same time. If done correctly, your character will "superglide" through the air and travel a decent distance. Supergliding is typically used to reposition yourself, or confuse your enemy during fights. There is also such thing as a directional superglide. To do a directional superglide, so the same steps as a normal superglide, but flick your left stick/ASD on your keyboard, and you will superglide in your ideal direction. If you are a PC player, you can combine superglides with "tap strafes' and do some really nasty plays. Unfourtunately I can't describe tap strafes because I'm a console player. We have limitations that PC players don't :)</p>
