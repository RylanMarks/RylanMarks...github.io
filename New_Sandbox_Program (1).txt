        <h1>Apex Legends Coaching</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my Apex Legends Coaching page. It goes over what tactics you can use to greatly improve your skill</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Apex Legends has many in-game mechanics thanks to it running on the same engine as both Titanfall games, with a few adjustments of course. Apex doesn't have the crazy mobility of Titanfall or Titanfall 2, but even without running on walls and double jumping, Movement is still the 2nd most important mechanic to learn, with the first most important mechanic being your aim with the guns.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Movement</h3>
        <p>As I said before, movement mechanics are the 2nd most important thing to learn in apex. Some movement tactics are very easy, and others are much harder, and some are exclusive to a certain platform, which is entirely stupid but they aren't going to change it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Slide Jumping</h3>
        <p>Slide jumping is as easy as the name describes. Simply jump at the top of your slide, or when you have the most momentum, which is usually at the beginning of your slide. You can do this often as it serves as a small movement boost to give you a little more speed, which comes in more handy then you think. For example, you need to jump on something but don't have enough momentum to make the jump. Do a slide jump to give the movement boost necessary to make it.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Wall Jump</h3>
        <p>A wall jump is entirely based around timing. It's not hard to do, but if timed wrong could entirely ruin the match. To do a wall jump, do a slide jump into a wall( you don't need to do a slide jump, but it is much more effective if you do), then as soon as you collide with the wall, tap the jump button. A wall jump is generally used to evade your enemy and get behind them, or to make your character harder to shoot.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Superglides</h3>
        <p>A superglide is the most difficult mechanic I will go over. Superglides; like wall jumps, are entirely based on timing, but are much harder to execute, and if failed, may cost the match. To do a superglide, you first have to mantle onto an object or the top of a wall. Then, right at the peak of your mantle, or before you climb up, hit the jump and crouch button at the same time. If done correctly, your character will "superglide" through the air and travel a decent distance. Supergliding is typically used to reposition yourself, or confuse your enemy during fights. There is also such thing as a directional superglide. To do a directional superglide, so the same steps as a normal superglide, but flick your left stick/ASD on your keyboard, and you will superglide in your ideal direction. If you are a PC player, you can combine superglides with "tap strafes' and do some really nasty plays. Unfourtunately I can't describe tap strafes because I'm a console player. We have limitations that PC players don't :)</p>

        <h1>Welcome to my blog page!</h1>
        <p>Here you will find all of my blog posts.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Article #1</h2>
        <p>I believe that video games are enticing and entertaining because they allow people to "transport into a new world". For example: You just got home from work or school and you want to wind down and do something fun. Well when you play a video game, you can stimulate brain activity without being physically active. I have used video games and still use them to sometimes escape reality when I am bored or stressed.</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-makes-video-games-fun">Article #1</a></li> 
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>This article starts off by saying that fun is relative to your situation. The author then goes on to say how the original Nintendo Entertainment System was the most fun thing around back when it came out, but in today's society, it is outdated and outclassed by newer games and systems. The author then states that "Video games are fun because they transport us to new realities and satisfy our needs for achievement and recognition. Video games also keep us interested with puzzles and mini-games, and engaged due to their attention to detail." For every new system and game that comes out, more and more details are added in to keep us entertained. Another reason we may play games is because we get a sense of achievement for in game awards, PlayStation Trophies, and Xbox Achievements. Getting these rewards give people a reason to play games in the first place.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Article #2</h2>
        <p>In this Blog Post I will go over a review about my favorite game: Titanfall 2. The great majority of reviews for this game are very positive. I would even say that 90% of reviews are 5 stars. The review I chose starts out by saying that Titanfall 2 is "An amazing shooter with lots of variety in both cosmetics and modes,with many weapons, titans, pilot abilities, pilot and gun colors/camo, maps, factions, banner cards and animations within combat" I would have to agree on this. There are so many different weapon, pilot, and titan skins. There are 7 different pilots you can use with their own abilities along with 7 different titans with their own kits as well. The review also described the movement in Titanfall 2. The game has movement mechanics never before seen in an FPS. The game allowed wallrunning and double jumping. The engine Titanfall 2 has also allowed the player to pretty much "fly" across the map with various movement techniques. I believe Titanfall 2 rightfully deserves its positive reviews.</p>

        <h2>Article #3</h2>
        <p>I have been a console gamer my whole life, so the idea of  even owning a PC seems unreal, but I have had a few thoughts about what my PC would be like. My dream PC is a desktop computer. Desktops computers do not only perform better, but they cost less as well. I would prioritize having a better GPU, RAM, and CPU than other parts. I would start my budget at about $1500 and upgrade it as I feel necessary. This would be a good computer for me because the only thing I want more than my dream car is a system that can handle more than 60 FPS. Because I still am a console gamer to this day, the closest I've come to matching a PC is my Xbox Series S. Most of my friends are PC gamers as well, so playing all on one platform would never cause disruptions.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Article #4</h2>
        <p>The game I will use for this blog post is called The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
This game is good because it has so many different possible things you can do. You can collect many different types of equipment such as weapons, clothing, materials, etc. There are also many different meals you can cook in this RPG, each with its own buff. There are also plenty of things to do and places to go. One of the main points of interest you will find throughout Hyrule are stables. You can stay a night there, sell/buy materials, and register horses to be your companion and source of transportation. There is so much more to this game that I did not mention because Nintendo worked their hearts out on it, and that's what makes a good RPG. A bad RPG would have a small map, little resources and gear, with a very linear storyline with not much to do outside of the main story.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Article #5</h2>
        <p>	Toxicity in games has been around ever since the first online game, especially in competitive games, such as Call of Duty, League of Legends, and similar games. It has arguably been a growing problem in recent years, and only now is some action being taken against it, such as Xbox's new "8 strike system". The most effective way to censor yourself to it is to simply block, mute, and/or report the player expressing toxic behavior. Toxic behavior could be prevented more effectively in the future if large gaming companies monitored their in-game voice and text chat more and set punishments along with it.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Article #6</h2>
        <p>One of the best Apex Legends ESports is TSM. TSM is one of the biggest esports teams today. They play more games than just Apex, such as PUBG, Rainbow 6, CS:GO, etc. The Apex TSM branch has made $2,005,374 in total prize money and have played in 139 tournaments, placing 3rd out of every other team. As a matter of fact, TSM placed first overall in the 2023 Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS)  tournament, winning them $600,000. They get better each year as new players are added to the team, such as "ImperialHal", who is considered to be one of the best apex players in the world.</p>
